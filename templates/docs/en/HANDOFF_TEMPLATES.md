# Handoff Templates — Prompt Contracts

Use these templates when the workflow path requires the Main Agent to hand work to a sub-agent or to generate a focused internal prompt. These are prompt contracts, not full process definitions. Routing, gates, and path selection live in [AGENCY_WORKFLOW.md](./AGENCY_WORKFLOW.md); role behavior lives in [TEAM_ROSTER.md](./TEAM_ROSTER.md).

A handoff prompt must be self-contained because sub-agents do not inherit the Main Agent's conversation, skills, or local context.

## 1. Base contract

Every handoff should include:

```text
Role:
Goal:
Inputs:
Required context:
Constraints:
Output format:
Context budget:
Done criteria:
```

Keep prompts short. Include only the context needed for the assigned scope.

Default context budget: do not return full transcripts, full diffs, full logs, or full file contents unless explicitly requested. If evidence is long, summarize it and cite the source path or command.

## 2. BA Discovery Prompt

```text
Role: Business Analyst (BA) lens.
Goal: Turn the user's idea into a clear PRD/scope proposal with user goals, core flows, acceptance criteria, assumptions, and blocking questions.
Inputs: User request, relevant business context, existing specs if any, and links to docs that constrain the feature.
Required context: AGENCY_WORKFLOW.md Full path Phase 1, COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md, ARTIFACTS_AND_STORAGE.md, and PRD_AI_FEATURE.md when the work is an AI/assistant feature.
Constraints: Do not design implementation details, choose technologies, or write code. Ask one blocking question at a time when the scope is unclear.
Output format: Summary, proposed scope, user personas or actors, main flows, acceptance criteria, assumptions, risks, blocking questions, and recommended next gate.
Done criteria: The Main Agent can present a PRD/scope artifact for user approval or knows exactly which blocking question to ask next.
```

## 3. Architect Planning Prompt

```text
Role: System Architect lens.
Goal: Convert approved scope into a technical plan with architecture notes, impact analysis, interface contracts, risks, and implementation tasks.
Inputs: Approved PRD/scope, relevant files or modules, impact-analysis results, constraints, and existing plans if any.
Required context: AGENCY_WORKFLOW.md Standard or Full path, TEAM_ROSTER.md, SECURITY_STANDARDS.md, PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md, ARTIFACTS_AND_STORAGE.md, and any brownfield discovery report.
Constraints: Do not edit code before the required gate. Do not broaden scope beyond the approved PRD. Warn on HIGH or CRITICAL impact before proceeding.
Output format: Architecture summary, affected areas, interface/API contract, security/performance considerations, task breakdown, verification plan, risks, and open decisions.
Done criteria: The Main Agent can present a technical plan for user approval and can split implementation into bounded tasks.
```

## 4. Implementer Prompt

```text
Role: Developer implementer.
Goal: Complete one bounded implementation task exactly as specified.
Inputs: Approved plan task, relevant files, interface contract, tests to run, and constraints.
Required context: The specific task text, AGENCY_WORKFLOW.md path requirements, test-driven-development when required, and relevant snippets or file paths.
Constraints: Do not modify unrelated files. Do not add features, abstractions, fallbacks, or refactors outside the assigned task. Ask for context if the task is ambiguous.
Output format: Status (DONE, DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, NEEDS_CONTEXT, or BLOCKED), files changed, tests run, evidence, concerns, and next recommended review.
Done criteria: The assigned task is implemented, path-required tests are run, and the Main Agent has enough evidence to start review.
```

## 5. Spec Compliance Reviewer Prompt

```text
Role: Spec compliance reviewer.
Goal: Check whether the implementation matches the approved PRD, plan, and task boundaries.
Inputs: Approved spec/plan, implementation summary, changed files, and test evidence.
Required context: The exact requirements being reviewed and any decision log entries that changed scope.
Constraints: Focus on missing requirements, extra behavior, contradictions, and ambiguous interpretations. Do not perform general style review unless it affects spec compliance.
Output format: Verdict, compliant items, missing items, extra behavior, ambiguities, required fixes, and file/path citations.
Context budget: Return only the verdict, high-signal gaps, evidence summary, and citations. Do not paste the full implementation or full spec.
Done criteria: The Main Agent knows whether to proceed to code quality review or send a focused fix prompt.
```

## 6. Code Quality Reviewer Prompt

```text
Role: Code quality reviewer.
Goal: Review changed code or docs for correctness, simplicity, reuse, maintainability, and efficiency.
Inputs: Changed files, implementation summary, and relevant constraints.
Required context: Project house rules, path-specific DoD, and any files needed to understand the changed surface.
Constraints: Prefer high-signal findings. Avoid style-only churn. Do not request broad refactors unrelated to the task.
Output format: Verdict, strengths, findings grouped by severity, suggested fixes, and file/path citations.
Context budget: Keep findings bounded and cite files. Do not paste full diffs, logs, or unrelated commentary.
Done criteria: The Main Agent knows whether the work is ready for final verification or needs targeted fixes.
```

## 7. QA / Security Reviewer Prompt

```text
Role: QA / Security reviewer.
Goal: Try to break the change and verify the path-specific Definition of Done, including security-sensitive behavior when applicable.
Inputs: Approved scope, implementation summary, changed files, test commands, verification evidence, and known risks.
Required context: DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md, SECURITY_STANDARDS.md, PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md when relevant, and AGENCY_WORKFLOW.md QA requirements.
Constraints: Do not rubber-stamp. Look for regressions, unsafe assumptions, missing validation at boundaries, permission/auth issues, AI guardrail gaps, and unverified claims.
Output format: Verdict, tests or checks reviewed, confirmed risks, suspected risks, missing evidence, required fixes, and file/path citations.
Context budget: Summarize long test/security evidence and cite commands or files. Do not paste full logs unless explicitly requested.
Done criteria: The Main Agent can either fix concrete issues or safely proceed to handover with evidence.
```

## 8. Brownfield Discovery Prompt

```text
Role: Brownfield discovery analyst.
Goal: Map existing project behavior before risky changes and separate evidence from assumptions.
Inputs: User request, BROWNFIELD_DISCOVERY.md if present, existing docs, likely code areas, tests, and known risky areas.
Required context: AGENCY_WORKFLOW.md brownfield rules, ARTIFACTS_AND_STORAGE.md, and COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md.
Constraints: Do not infer business purpose without evidence. Do not change code. Mark uncertain areas as needing human confirmation.
Output format: Evidence-backed findings, likely areas, tests/commands found, risky flows, assumptions, confirmation questions, and recommended path escalation.
Done criteria: The Main Agent knows whether the work can proceed, must escalate to Standard, or needs user confirmation first.
```

## 9. Handover / Retro Prompt

```text
Role: Handover and Scrum Master lens.
Goal: Close the work with evidence, state updates, remaining risks, and a lightweight retro.
Inputs: Completed implementation summary, review results, verification evidence, changed artifacts, and unresolved risks.
Required context: ARTIFACTS_AND_STORAGE.md, DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md, BRANCHING.md, and the active workflow path.
Constraints: Do not claim completion without verification evidence. Do not hide unresolved risks. Do not update canonical docs unless the change introduced durable process or architecture decisions.
Output format: What changed, verification evidence, artifacts updated, unresolved risks, handover notes, and three-line retro.
Context budget: Summarize evidence and link artifacts. Do not duplicate full reports, diffs, or transcripts.
Done criteria: The Main Agent can report completion accurately and knows whether finishing-a-development-branch or another closeout step is needed.
```
