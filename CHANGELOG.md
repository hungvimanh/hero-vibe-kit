# Changelog

All notable changes to hero-vibe-kit are documented here. Format based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-06
### Added
- Process-first self-prompting workflow guidance so the Main Agent classifies task type, selects the workflow path, generates bounded handoff prompts, verifies gates, updates artifacts, and chooses the next prompt from workflow state.
- Bilingual `HANDOFF_TEMPLATES.md` prompt contracts for BA discovery, architect planning, implementer, reviewers, brownfield discovery, and handover/retro.
- Bilingual `CONTEXT_BUDGET.md` protocol with no-dump rules, mandatory checkpoint triggers, resume packet format, `/compact` prompt, fresh-session prompt, sub-agent output limits, tool-output hygiene, and API 400 recovery.

### Changed
- Reframed `TEAM_ROSTER.md` as a conditional role/lens library with context-budget rules for the Main Agent and bounded sub-agent outputs.
- Updated `AGENCY_WORKFLOW.md` to include the Self-Prompting Router, next-prompt decision table, and Context Budget Protocol.
- Updated `ARTIFACTS_AND_STORAGE.md` to define `reports/.../resume.md` as the compact/session-restart artifact for long-running work, handoffs, final verification, and context-pressure recovery.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-03
### Added
- Vendored core process skills under `templates/skills/` (a curated, lightly trimmed MIT copy of `obra/superpowers`, with `NOTICE` attribution). `init`/`update` install them into a consumer's `.claude/skills/` — no `skills` CLI or network needed.
- Design docs: a concise **references-first (avoid AI-slop)** section (gather real references from Dribbble/Mobbin/Behance/Muzli, generate variations, avoid LLM defaults), an optional design-MCP note (browser/Figma), and an optional storytelling layer; `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` now requires named references.
- Tests for vendored skills, install/refresh into `.claude/skills/`, and the recalibrated sub-agent wording.

### Changed
- **Sub-agent policy recalibrated** (per the "context-collector" model): required review/QA stays path-triggered, but **delegating implementation is now optional** — the main agent implements with full context by default and delegates Dev work only when it genuinely helps. "Not every task needs a sub-agent." Mirrored across AGENCY_WORKFLOW, TEAM_ROSTER, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md templates, and the Serena delegation memo.
- `init`/`update` no longer run `npx skills add obra/superpowers`; core skills are bundled. `doctor` now checks `.claude/skills/` instead of `skills-lock.json`. Manifest `process` group marked `vendored`/`bundled` with MIT attribution.

### Removed
- The `writing-skills` meta skill from the installed set (consumers don't author skills).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-03
### Changed
- Optimized installed Claude/agent instructions with just-in-time context loading so agents read path-specific docs only when needed.
- Reduced duplicated workflow guidance across roster, DoD, artifact, active-state, and brownfield discovery docs while preserving Standard/Full gate and sub-agent requirements.
- Made brownfield discovery output summary-first to avoid turning old-project scans into large context sinks.

### Added
- Tests for compact installed guidance, update refresh behavior, rendered placeholder cleanup, and EN/VI docs file-set parity.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-03
### Added
- `discover` / `brownfield` command to scan old codebases and generate `docs/BROWNFIELD_DISCOVERY.md` without assuming docs live in `docs/`.
- Bilingual `BROWNFIELD_DISCOVERY.md` template and workflow guidance for old projects: `init` → `discover` → `doctor`.

### Changed
- `init` and `update` preserve an existing `docs/BROWNFIELD_DISCOVERY.md` so human/AI discovery notes are not overwritten.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-03
### Added
- Design UI/UX sub-workflow: bilingual `DESIGN_STANDARDS.md` with 3 product-fit profiles, UX↔UI split, job→skill routing, platform scope, media production, visual QA, and in-product help/onboarding standards.
- `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` template for clarifying UI/UX before implementation.
- Router row #9 for UI/UX design/redesign work, plus Phase 1–4 design steps folded into the existing Gate 2 flow.
- `design/` branch prefix and Design/UI Definition of Done items.
- Design artifact locations for `docs/design/`, `docs/design/assets/`, `docs/help/`, and visual QA reports.
- Optional provider-agnostic AI media-generation config that stores only provider + environment variable name, never the API key value.

### Changed
- Split design skills in `skills.manifest.json` into `brand`, `design-direction`, and `design-tools` groups.
- Updated optional integration install flow to install design skill sources safely and skip placeholder sources.
- Updated Human ↔ AI communication guidance to prefer simple language, explain from the user's goal first, and reduce hard technical terms unless requested.

## [0.2.0] - Previous
### Added
- `npx hero-vibe-kit init` — installs the workflow into a project (new or brownfield), idempotent, with backups.
- `update` — re-renders framework-managed regions while preserving user edits and working files (ACTIVE_STATE).
- `doctor` — validates settings.json, hook self-tests, doc-link integrity, and tool presence.
- Bilingual docs (EN + VI): AGENCY_WORKFLOW (task-type router + 5 phases), DEFINITION_OF_DONE, BRANCHING,
  TEAM_ROSTER, ACTIVE_STATE, ARTIFACTS_AND_STORAGE, COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL, INTERACTION_PATTERNS,
  SECURITY_STANDARDS, PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS, and a PRD_AI_FEATURE template.
- Enforcement hooks for Claude Code: `git-guard` (blocks force-push / `--no-verify` / `reset --hard` /
  direct push to main; reminds on commit) and `stop-reminder`.
- Managed-region markers (`<!-- hero-vibe-kit:start/end -->`) for safe updates.
- Presets: solo, small-team, enterprise.
- Optional integrations (reference & auto-install, never bundled): superpowers/taste skills via the `skills`
  CLI, GitNexus indexing, and Serena semantic code-intelligence support. All degrade gracefully when absent.
